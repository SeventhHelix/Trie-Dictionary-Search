An implementation of a dictionary using a Trie structure. 

Allows the user to add words to the dictionary, subtract words, query a word, 
or include a filename in the current directory to execute the commands listed inside.

Possible commands: 
    + word  -   Adds 'word' to dictionary
    - word  -   Removes 'word' from dictionary
    ? word  -   Queries 'word', printing a list of all words in the dictionary beginning with 'word'
    include filename    -   Executes the commands listed in 'filename'

Note that this program will only work for words that use the standard 26-letter alphabet.

To compile, simply run 'make'
